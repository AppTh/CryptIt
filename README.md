# CryptIt
Easy Encryption from contextmenu

WARNING!! THIS PROGRAM WILL IRREVERSABLY ENCRYPT THE FILES YOU CHOOSE. PLEASE REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD.

Instructions:

<p>Tested on Python 3.4.3. Needs PyCrypto to work (install with e.g. pip install pycrypto)</p>

<p>Add eCrypt.bat to contextmenu in registry</p>
<p>Add dCrypt.bat to .crypt file extension in registry</p>

<p> There is also a binary package available (tested on windows 8.1 and windows server 2008). 
To use it, extract contents to desired location and run install.bat with admin priv. This will add some keys to the registry which makes a shortcut available in the contextmenu. and associates .crypt files with CryptIt.exe</p>

<p>(obviously this install method won't pass windows smart screening, so one has to manually allow it when that prompt pops up. Please examine the install.bat file before installing.)
